```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
av <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/avengers/avengers.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```


```{r}
summary(av)
```
```{r}
av2 = gather(av, key=Time, Death, c(11,13,15,17,19))
av2$Time = parse_number(av2$Time)
head(av2)
```

## Including Plot

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
